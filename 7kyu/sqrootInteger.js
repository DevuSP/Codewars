// Q1 A square of squares
// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

// Examples
// -1  =>  false
//  0  =>  true
//  3  =>  false
//  4  =>  true
// 25  =>  true
// 26  =>  false

solution1
var isSquare = function(n){
    if(Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(n))){ //Number.isInteger()checks if it is an integer and passes true or false.
       return true;
       }
    else{
    return false; 
  }
    }

// Q2 You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

// Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

// If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.

// Examples:(Input --> Output)

// 121 --> 144
// 625 --> 676
// 114 --> -1 since 114 is not a perfect square

solution2
function findNextSquare(sq) {
  if(Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(sq))){
   let sqrt = Math.sqrt(sq) + 1;
    sqrt = sqrt * sqrt;
    return sqrt
  }
  else{
  return -1;
}
  }
